    <h1><strong>The Challenge of Teaching
                   Effectively From a Distance</strong></h1>

    <p>
        Distance learning has the potential to be as powerful at successful instruction as conventional classroom learning. To take advantage of this potential, planners and educators should apply known principles of perception and learning gleaned from cognitive, behavioral, educational, and perceptual psychological research. These principles include those of elaborative encoding, interactive learning, reinforcement and the spacing effect. These principles and their relationship to human learning are presented. Applications of these principles in conventional distance learning packages are discussed, including Web page development, course-in-a-box software, chat rooms, MUD/MOO environments, bulletin boards and real-time online lectures. Suggestions are provided to guide the course designer in developing effective instructional tools.</p>
    <p>
        Janet, a student in a traditional classroom, is taken on a field trip as part of her studies of the history of her hometown. She goes on a walking tour of the downtown area with a guide. They stop to read plaques on important buildings, and Janet asks questions about some of the strange architecture she sees. Her guide points out aspects of the geography of the area that affected the development of the urban area; Janet looks up a street and sees the steep hill leading to an old church, and notices the smell of sea air in the still-bustling market center. After the tour, Janet is assigned a project: building a model of one of the buildings she has seen.</p>
    <p>
        David is taking an online course in local history offered by his city’s community college Website. Each week he connects and reads the latest chapter of the online text. He looks at online pictures of famous local buildings. Every six weeks, he takes an online “midterm.” If he passes two midterms and a final, he will pass the class and earn credits.</p>
    <p>
        Most educators would probably agree that Janet’s experience was “richer.” But while one might suspect that it was also more effective for learning and retaining information about the subject, it might not be clear precisely why this is so. In fact, it is likely that her experience would lead to longer retention and better comprehension of the subject matter. This is not, however, an inherent disadvantage of distance learning. Rather, it is a difference in pedagogical approaches. With care, an online course can be made equally effective—even if not always equally sensually engaging. (It’s hard to smell the sea through the computer screen!)</p><br>Instructors are spending increasing amounts of time and energy converting their courses into distance education. They create Web-based classes and local public broadcasting courses, and make use of packaged courseware, “drill-and-practice” software, and tools to enhance traditional face-to-face teaching environments. Students are beginning to embrace the new formats, but how certain can an instructor be that her students are truly learning the material? If she runs into one of them a year later, what will he be able to tell her about the subject matter? Will the student be able to translate and transfer what he has learned into his life, his work, his understanding of the world?
    <p>
        Much of the research into technology education has focused on the hurdles of attracting and keeping students’ attention, interest and participation. For example, the TLT Group’s respected Flashlight Program (1999; 2000; 2001) focuses on analysis of accessibility, technology barriers, and tracking use of educational technology installations. An article on “The effects of electronic classrooms on learning English composition” (Stinson & Claus, 2000) contains many references to aspects of the class that students “liked” or “disliked,” and focuses on faculty/course evaluations as a method of evaluating technology enhancement success or failure. In the 1990s, a successful educational product was one that kept students involved and motivated to use it for the largest number of hours and the longest stretch of weeks. The research and applications focus has been, understandably, on assessing and improving student participation.</p>
    <p>
        As educational technology moves into its next decade, practitioners and planners are beginning to evaluate whether or not a product successfully teaches (see, Smith & Warren, 1999), notes Patti Harvey, a consultant quoted in Geith (1999), “Faculty start to question what is working. We are now focusing on what learning is, how we describe it, and what that means for current approaches to how we measure for learning.” Developing successful distance learning programs is going to require careful attention to, and incorporation of, successful conventional instructional methods, appropriate application of conventional and new student assessment methods (such as testing), and an organized empirical approach. In addition to all that, it will require a re-examination of what is known about perception, learning, memory, and the brain, and the incorporation of that knowledge into instructional design.</p>
    <p>
        The development of educational curriculum and teaching methodology is most successful when it is informed by educational research. Educational research, in turn, is most specific and accurate when informed by psychological research—especially work in the areas of behavioral, perceptual, cognitive and educational psychology. Classroom methods tend to incorporate ad hoc methods into the mix—things that a particular instructor has found or believes to be effective. Often, these discoveries are shared in workshops and books developed for face-to-face instructors, and are subsequently analyzed in terms of their psychological effectiveness.</p>
    <p>
        Such work has not, however, been applied as frequently to educational technology design. In fact, careful study of many of the educational products available for developers of distance courseware reveals influences from a wide range of non-research sources. Such sources include video games, early Internet communication technologies (that in turn drew on community communication metaphors, such as the newspaper and public bulletin boards), and old-fashioned “drill-and-practice” teaching techniques that are no longer heavily practiced in a modern, live classroom. In addition, developers of course websites and other courseware unthinkingly may convert bad or ineffective classroom practices into bad online practices, simply because they are familiar.</p>
    <p>
        As much as there is still to be learned about the human mind and human learning, what is known provides powerful suggestions about effective teaching. With the rapid growth of distance learning, it’s timely to look at some of the most important psychological principles of learning and see how they might be exploited to create the most effective possible distance learning environment.</p>
    <h1><strong>ELABORATIVE ENCODING</strong></h1>
    <p>
        The most basic element of learning is probably the storage of information in long-term memory. From research in cognitive psychology, it is known that elaborative encoding—using information to be remembered in a creatively constructed, meaningful way—vastly increases memory for that information at a later time. The more meaningful the construction, the greater is the likelihood of retention over the longest period of time (Bradshaw & Anderson, 1982).</p>
            <p>
                Most computer-based instruction programs make some attempt to incorporate elaborative encoding into their structure. Some are more successful than others (and some are successful purely by accident). In many interactive self-paced training and instructional programs, students are encouraged to attempt to “fill-in-the-blank” to provide the missing term in a sentence. This technique is especially popular in some of the early multimedia-rich training CD-ROMs—an intermediate step between the traditional classroom and online instruction. In many of these, the student either is asked to “guess” what might be coming next in the lecture (that is, the needed information cannot be derived from the preceding text), or to regurgitate something, in a prescribed form, that has recently been presented. This is not the most effective elaboration; it is fairly shallow processing and may not lead to lasting memory.</p><p>Yet this type of exercise is still very popular in corporate and professional computer-based training. It is even found in academic environments, especially in the context of staff development training.</p>
    <p>
        “Course-in-a-box” software packages provide a simple way for faculty or teaching assistants to construct a course website without programming knowledge. These applications can be used from anywhere on the Internet, rather than past modes of needing software in a particular lab or relying on CD-ROM-based instructional aids. Tools such as a bulletin board or chat room can be added with a “point and click.” Other commonly included tools are password protection, grade posting, image databases, and glossary tools. Administrative departments such as health and safety are often anxious to leverage such institutional instructional technology investments to reduce personnel costs for training. Rather than using the packages in a meaningful way, however, they convert old “fill-in-the-blank” quizzes to an online format, and remove some of the valuable aspects of classroom instruction (such as interaction with instructors) without looking for online replacements.</p>
    <p>
        But many “course-in-a-box” applications, such as WebCT, offer an excellent opportunity for elaborative encoding: they have the capability to permit the student to develop his or her own Web page. If the student creates a website to present to others some aspect of the material that she has studied, learning can be enhanced. The process of reorganizing information in order to teach others is intensely elaborative.</p>
    <p>
        This facility is extremely valuable—more so than less structured offerings such as chat rooms. Conventional classroom teachers have realized for years that creative constructions using course material are incredibly effective. Like a book report, a science fair project, and the seminar-style class (typical of graduate studies, where each student in turn presents new material to his fellow students), the creation of a website gives the student an opportunity to meaningfully encode the material he has been taught.</p>
    <p>
        At Mount Union College in Alliance, Ohio, Jim Phillips takes the elaborative online assignment one step further. He asks students in his instructional design courses to develop full-blown online tutorials that instruct others on a topic they are studying. This causes the students not only to use learned material in an elaborative way, but to examine in depth their logic and grasp of the subject by asking and anticipating questions from their own audience (J. Phillips, personal interview with C. Bagwell, 2000).</p>
    <p>
        MUD/MOO text-based virtual environments are becoming increasingly popular in educational applications. MUDs are modeled after 1970s textbased computer adventure games such as Adventure and Zork. They place the user in a virtual world, where he can navigate from room-to-room and interact with objects found there using plain English-style commands. MUDs, however, provide access to multiple users at the same time, and permit users to interact with each other in the virtual environment (for example, users in the same virtual “pub” may chat, order beers for each other, and look around at an identical text-based scene). MUDs also have features that, more than simple chat rooms, allow the creative educator to develop ideal environments for elaborative encoding. There are several aspects of MUDs/MOOs that enable elaboration:
    <ul>
        <li>context–rich conversational environments</li>
        <li>the ability to develop relevant yet appealing educational “adventures” or “quests,” where students must use both their knowledge of the subject matter and their reasoning and problem-solving skills to work their way through a process. (MUD “quests” resemble interactive experiencebased problem-solving/teaching games such as the Learning Company’s Carmen Sandiego (2001).)</li>
        <li>“‘Bots” (programs that interact with students as if they were simply another participant). These can be programmed to converse with the student on the topic of interest, to provide feedback and reinforcement for discussion of relevant subject matter, and to offer hints, more advanced information, and explanations in response to creatively phrased questions from the student.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Mike O’Brien of the Aerospace Corporation used MUD technology to create an Egyptology quest, known as TinyLondon. The quest provides participants with an exciting and mentally challenging text-based adventure game—and, in the process, teaches them several aspects of the Middle Egyptian language.</p>
    <p>
        The adventurer wanders through the Nile Valley, collecting scraps of parchment ostensibly written by Herodotus, the Greek historian. For example, you see a bit of vellum on the ground and look at it:</p>
    <h4>look vellum</h4>
    <p>“For whatever reason, these Ancients appeared never to vary their verbs, as we do, so that commands and statements sounded alike in their ears, and past, present and future were but ill-distinguished. Thus, J3I, to cross a stream or river, has no other forms or conjugation.”</p>
            <p>
                Later, you sit at the bank of the Nile, which you’d like to cross. You see a boat:</p>
    <h4>look boat</h4>
    <p>
        There is a boat here, with no one in it. It is made out of woven papyrus reeds, and bobs gently against the bank of the river.</p>
    <h4>Get into boat</h4>
    <p>
        You climb into a rickety-looking, shaky boat made out of papyrus reeds.<br>In a Boat(#9538R)<br>The boat is sound, though seemingly fragile. It does not move, but you sense that it could take you where you wish if you expressed yourself properly </p>
    <p>You might try a few English commands with no effect:</p>
    <h4>cross</h4>
    <p>Huh? (Type “help” for help.)</p>
    <h4>Go across</h4>
    <p>* You can’t go that way.</p>
    <h4>Take me across</h4>
    <p>* I don’t see that here.</p>
    <p>Finally, you remember that scrap of vellum you read about Middle Egyptian verbs, and its casual reference to crossing streams. You say:</p>
    <h4>J3I</h4>
    <p>
        The boat hears your command, and you are whisked quickly and silently across the breadth of the Nile.</p>
            <p>
                (M. O’Brien, personal interview with V. Polichar, September, 1999).</p>
            <p>A great deal of potential exists in the use of MUDs/MOOs for education. One early adopter of this technology is Reed Riner, a professor of anthropology at Northern Arizona University (NAU) who for many years in the early 1990s taught a class in futures anthropology using a MUD (Riner & Clodius, 1995). Remote participants included not only the students at NAU, but also sister classes at the University of Dayton (under John Bregenzer) and other schools and advisors scattered around the U.S. and Canada.</p>
    <h2><strong>ONLINE INTERACTIVE DISCUSSION</strong></h2>
    <p>
        Work by Frase and Schwartz (1975) indicates that having students work together, taking turns asking and answering questions about course material, improves subsequent test performance. A bulletin or discussion board offers an excellent structured environment for such discourse, and can be an effective learning tool for online courses. As opposed to a chat room or a MUD/MOO, a discussion board offers students an asynchronous forum for communication. A discussion board gives students as much time as needed to formulate their thoughts and questions. It forgives slow typing, and provides a forum for the shy and for those less adept with English. (The inherent time delay between question and answer in this environment may also be beneficial, if students go on studying other material in the interim; this useful effect will be discussed later in the chapter.)</p>
    <p>
        Chat rooms are a popular enhancement to online courses, but have the potential to be a dead end for learning. Students may chat about anything and everything—and not necessarily course material. (At the authors’ home university, chat rooms have become known as “Hey, babe!” rooms.) Worse, chat rooms may lead to both elaboration and reinforcement of mistakes and incorrect understandings of course material.</p>
    <p>
        For faculty who want students to interact, but who want control over where the discussion leads, discussion board systems (such as DISCUS, WebBoard or facilities in Blackboard’s CourseInfo or WebCT) are preferable. Message-queuing features offer moderators the option to post or reject messages, so that faculty or TAs can ensure that messages are on target, concepts are being explained accurately, and facts being shared are correct. The interactive quality of these systems makes them nearly as appealing to students as chat rooms, but usually more pedagogically appropriate. (Alternatively, in a MUD or MOO environment, TAs, faculty, or even “Bots” can remain present in real-time to guide the discussion or answer questions.)</p>
    <p>
        Chat rooms can be useful if tightly controlled. Teaching assistants at the University of California-San Diego, use them to provide virtual office hours prior to exams. A 9–11 p.m. on-campus study session is often impractical for working and married students. However, offered online, virtual office hours provide students with an opportunity to have critical questions answered in the comfort of their own homes.</p>
    <p>
        Some programs, such as WebCT, allow for review of the chat room logs. Care must be taken, however, not to violate local privacy policies, especially in the university environment. It may also foster an atmosphere of distrust that could lead to decreased use of the environment. Finally, when an instructor corrects a student’s misconception based on a log, the correction is received long after the concept has been voiced, and encoded, by the student. It is entirely likely that the misunderstanding will be what is remembered, unless the instructor requires an elaborative task to be performed along with the receipt of the correction.</p>
    <p>
        Other skills are learned in the educational process besides the specifictopic at hand. Carol B. MacKnight points out that students “need coaching and practice in how to carry on online discussions. Initially, faculty must step in and support disciplined discussions… in monitoring discussions or group work activity, faculty must engage in a line of questioning that will continue to drive an idea, thus helping students develop and apply critical thinking skills.” These “critical skills” are important for elaborative encoding, and hence for learning (MacKnight, 2000).</p><p>Theodore Groves, of the University of California-San Diego, would agree. He found it initially challenging to accept student questions via electronic mail without returning the exact answer immediately. Ideally, in a face-to-face office hours situation, an instructor would not simply give out an answer but instead guide students into arriving at solutions themselves by giving hints, supplying leading information and asking the students questions. It takes extra attention to apply this technique in an asynchronous medium, be it electronic mail or a bulletin board, but it is necessary to take full advantage of the value introduced by the technology (T. Groves, personal conversation with C. Bagwell, 2000; Knowlton, Knowlton & Davis, 2000). Effective use of teaching technology will help the student “go beyond being exposed to content to the point of critically interacting with it” (MacKnight, 2000).</p>
    <h3><strong>REINFORCEMENT</strong></h3>
    <p>
        Reinforcers help to increase the likelihood that a given behavior will happen again (Thorndike, 1898). More colloquially, rewarding a person’s action makes the person likely to repeat that action. Many educational software developers have incorporated this notion into their programs. For example, in an addition drill program for children, successful completion of the presented math problem might result in a song being played.</p>
            <p>
                There are several challenges in using reinforcement to enhance learning, but one of the most compelling is that it is not always effective. The very first</p></div>
